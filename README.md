## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Base hooks: useState, useContext, useRef

### What I learned

I used new hook for me it is **useContext**. I combinet it with **useState**


```js
export const dataMFContext = React.createContext();
...
...
const [dataTotal, setDataTotal] = React.useState({ ... });
<dataMFContext.Provider value={{ dataTotal, setDataTotal }}>
  {conditionalComponent()}
</dataMFContext.Provider>
```

### Continued development

On other projects, I would like to explore the Redux example.
